# HW1: Angry Bunny
Without using the built-in physics engine in Unity, a simple rigid body dynamics solver is implemented in this assignment ( in file `Rigid_Bunny.cs` ). The rigid body collision detection and response are handled by the impulse method and it is only able to behave correctly colliding with the floor and the wall.
