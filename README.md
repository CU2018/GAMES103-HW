# HW1: Angry Bunny
Without using the built-in physics engine in Unity, two simple rigid body dynamics solvers are implemented in this assignment. Physic-based rigid body dynamics solver is in the `assets/scripts/Rigid_Bunny.cs`, while the shape matching method (non-physics-based) is implemented in the file `assets/scripts/Rigid_Bunny_by_Shape_Matching.cs`. The rigid body collision detection and response are handled by the impulse method and it is only able to behave correctly colliding with the floor and the wall.
